What part of the code was most confusing and why?
Understanding how the setInterval function works. Reading the nesting callback func declared in the argument makes it difficult to distinguish the borders of one function from the other.
How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
By visually seeing one function executing then knowing that it was stopped the the function called below it in the thread of operation. 
What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I changed the status element's text content once the setInterval function had cycled through half of it's total cycles alloted in the maxCycles condition.
